# Department Store Project

This is my Department Store Project that has a Next.js frontend with a Django and DjangoREST backend that utilizes a MySQL database.

Here is a link to the website so that you can test all the features:

## IMPORTANT NOTICE:
The backend of this project is hosted on Render's free tier. According to Render the "free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more".

I have attempted to mitigate this issue using an uptime ticker. However, it is possible that the ticker fails, and the instance
has spun down. In this case, just wait for a minute and the application will proceed as normal.
